ClawHub is the **public skill registry for Clawdbot**: publish, version, and search text-based agent skills (a `SKILL.md` plus supporting files).
It’s designed for fast browsing + a CLI-friendly API, with moderation hooks and vector search.

onlycrabs.ai is the **SOUL.md registry**: publish and share system lore the same way you publish skills.

Live: `https://clawhub.ai`
onlycrabs.ai: `https://onlycrabs.ai`

## What you can do with it

- Browse skills + render their `SKILL.md`.
- Publish new skill versions with changelogs + tags (including `latest`).
- Browse souls + render their `SOUL.md`.
- Publish new soul versions with changelogs + tags.
- Search via embeddings (vector index) instead of brittle keywords.
- Star + comment; admins/mods can curate and approve skills.
- **Monitor OpenClaw agents in real-time** via the live dashboard.

## Live OpenClaw Dashboard

The live dashboard (`/live`) streams events from OpenClaw agents in real-time, displaying:

- **Session info**: Current agent session, event count, and last activity timestamp
- **Hypotheses**: Active, stale, and resolved hypotheses with confidence scores
- **Event timeline**: Recent events showing agent activity

### Accessing the Live Dashboard

1. Navigate to `/live` on your ClawHub instance
2. By default, it monitors `agent:crawfather:main`
3. To monitor a different session, add a query parameter: `/live?sessionKey=agent:myagent:main`

### How it works

- **Polling**: The dashboard polls `/api/v1/openclaw/events` every 2 seconds for new events
- **Auto-reconnect**: Automatically handles connection errors and reconnects
- **Incremental updates**: Only fetches new events since the last known timestamp
- **Session persistence**: Events are stored in Convex and persist across page refreshes

### Event Types

- `hypothesis_created`: New hypothesis generated by the agent
- `hypothesis_updated`: Existing hypothesis updated with new score or status
- `hypothesis_resolved`: Hypothesis marked as resolved
- `task_completed`: Agent completed a task
- `error`: Error occurred during agent execution
- `info`: General informational message

### Testing with Sample Data

To seed sample events for testing:

```bash
# Using Convex CLI
bunx convex run openclawEventsSeed:seedSampleEvents --sessionKey "agent:crawfather:main"
```

This creates a realistic set of sample events showing hypothesis creation, updates, and resolution.

## onlycrabs.ai (SOUL.md registry)

- Entry point is host-based: `onlycrabs.ai`.
- On the onlycrabs.ai host, the home page and nav default to souls.
- On ClawHub, souls live under `/souls`.
- Soul bundles only accept `SOUL.md` for now (no extra files).

## How it works (high level)

- Web app: TanStack Start (React, Vite/Nitro).
- Backend: Convex (DB + file storage + HTTP actions) + Convex Auth (GitHub OAuth).
- Search: OpenAI embeddings (`text-embedding-3-small`) + Convex vector search.
- API schema + routes: `packages/schema` (`clawhub-schema`).


## Telemetry

ClawHub tracks minimal **install telemetry** (to compute install counts) when you run `clawhub sync` while logged in.
Disable via:

```bash
export CLAWHUB_DISABLE_TELEMETRY=1
```

Details: `docs/telemetry.md`.

## Repo layout

- `src/` — TanStack Start app (routes, components, styles).
- `convex/` — schema + queries/mutations/actions + HTTP API routes.
- `packages/schema/` — shared API types/routes for the CLI and app.
- `docs/spec.md` — product + implementation spec (good first read).

## Local dev

Prereqs: Bun + Convex CLI.

```bash
bun install
cp .env.local.example .env.local

# terminal A: web app
bun run dev

# terminal B: Convex dev deployment
bunx convex dev
```

## Auth (GitHub OAuth) setup

Create a GitHub OAuth App, set `AUTH_GITHUB_ID` / `AUTH_GITHUB_SECRET`, then:

```bash
bunx auth --deployment-name <deployment> --web-server-url http://localhost:3000
```

This writes `JWT_PRIVATE_KEY` + `JWKS` to the deployment and prints values for your local `.env.local`.

## Environment

- `VITE_CONVEX_URL`: Convex deployment URL (`https://<deployment>.convex.cloud`).
- `VITE_CONVEX_SITE_URL`: Convex site URL (`https://<deployment>.convex.site`).
- `VITE_SOULHUB_SITE_URL`: onlycrabs.ai site URL (`https://onlycrabs.ai`).
- `VITE_SOULHUB_HOST`: onlycrabs.ai host match (`onlycrabs.ai`).
- `VITE_SITE_MODE`: Optional override (`skills` or `souls`) for SSR builds.
- `CONVEX_SITE_URL`: same as `VITE_CONVEX_SITE_URL` (auth + cookies).
- `SITE_URL`: App URL (local: `http://localhost:3000`).
- `AUTH_GITHUB_ID` / `AUTH_GITHUB_SECRET`: GitHub OAuth App.
- `JWT_PRIVATE_KEY` / `JWKS`: Convex Auth keys.
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: embeddings for search + indexing.

## Nix plugins (nixmode skills)

ClawHub can store a nix-clawdbot plugin pointer in SKILL frontmatter so the registry knows which
Nix package bundle to install. A nix plugin is different from a regular skill pack: it bundles the
skill pack, the CLI binary, and its config flags/requirements together.

Add this to `SKILL.md`:

```yaml
---
name: peekaboo
description: Capture and automate macOS UI with the Peekaboo CLI.
metadata: {"clawdbot":{"nix":{"plugin":"github:clawdbot/nix-steipete-tools?dir=tools/peekaboo","systems":["aarch64-darwin"]}}}
---
```

Install via nix-clawdbot:

```nix
programs.clawdbot.plugins = [
  { source = "github:clawdbot/nix-steipete-tools?dir=tools/peekaboo"; }
];
```

You can also declare config requirements + an example snippet:

```yaml
---
name: padel
description: Check padel court availability and manage bookings via Playtomic.
metadata: {"clawdbot":{"config":{"requiredEnv":["PADEL_AUTH_FILE"],"stateDirs":[".config/padel"],"example":"config = { env = { PADEL_AUTH_FILE = \\\"/run/agenix/padel-auth\\\"; }; };"}}}
---
```

To show CLI help (recommended for nix plugins), include the `cli --help` output:

```yaml
---
name: padel
description: Check padel court availability and manage bookings via Playtomic.
metadata: {"clawdbot":{"cliHelp":"padel --help\\nUsage: padel [command]\\n"}}
---
```

`metadata.clawdbot` is preferred, but `metadata.clawdis` is accepted as an alias for compatibility.

## Scripts

```bash
bun run dev
bun run build
bun run test
bun run coverage
bun run lint
```
