# Daily Repository Report Workflow
#
# This workflow generates a daily report of all repositories owned by EvezArt.
# It queries the GitHub GraphQL API to collect repository metadata and generates
# both JSON and CSV reports that are uploaded as artifacts.
#
# REPORT_TOKEN Configuration:
# ---------------------------
# The REPORT_TOKEN should be a GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT) with 'repo' scope
# to access both public and private repositories. If not set, the workflow will only
# access public repositories using unauthenticated requests.
#
# To set the REPORT_TOKEN secret:
#
# Using GitHub CLI:
#   echo "YOUR_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN" | gh secret set REPORT_TOKEN --repo EvezArt/crawhub
#
# Using GitHub UI:
#   1. Go to Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions
#   2. Click "New repository secret"
#   3. Name: REPORT_TOKEN
#   4. Value: Your Personal Access Token
#   5. Click "Add secret"
#
# To create a Personal Access Token:
#   1. Go to GitHub Settings > Developer settings > Personal access tokens > Tokens (classic)
#   2. Click "Generate new token (classic)"
#   3. Give it a descriptive note (e.g., "Repository Report Workflow")
#   4. Select the 'repo' scope (Full control of private repositories)
#   5. Click "Generate token"
#   6. Copy the token and add it as a secret using one of the methods above
