# Daily Repository Report Workflow
#
# This workflow generates a daily report of all repositories for the owner EvezArt.
# It supports private repositories when the REPORT_TOKEN secret is configured.
#
# REPORT_TOKEN Configuration:
# ---------------------------
# To include private repositories in the report, set the REPORT_TOKEN secret to a
# GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT) with 'repo' scope.
#
# CLI Configuration:
#   echo "YOUR_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN" | gh secret set REPORT_TOKEN --repo EvezArt/crawhub
#
# UI Configuration:
#   1. Go to Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions
#   2. Click "New repository secret"
#   3. Name: REPORT_TOKEN
#   4. Value: <your PAT with repo scope>
#   5. Click "Add secret"
#
# If REPORT_TOKEN is not set, the workflow will only access public repositories.
