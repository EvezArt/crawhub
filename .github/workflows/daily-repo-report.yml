# Daily Repository Report Workflow
#
# This workflow generates a comprehensive report of all repositories owned by the organization.
# It runs daily at midnight UTC and can also be triggered manually.
#
# Setup Instructions for REPORT_TOKEN:
#
# The REPORT_TOKEN secret is optional but required to include private repositories in the report.
# It should be a GitHub Personal Access Token (classic) with 'repo' scope.
#
# To create a Personal Access Token:
# 1. Go to GitHub Settings > Developer settings > Personal access tokens > Tokens (classic)
# 2. Click "Generate new token (classic)"
# 3. Give it a descriptive name (e.g., "Repository Report Token")
# 4. Select the 'repo' scope (Full control of private repositories)
# 5. Click "Generate token" and copy the token
#
# To set the token as a repository secret via GitHub CLI:
#   echo "YOUR_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN" | gh secret set REPORT_TOKEN --repo EvezArt/crawhub
#
# To set the token via GitHub UI:
# 1. Go to repository Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions
# 2. Click "New repository secret"
# 3. Name: REPORT_TOKEN
# 4. Value: Paste your Personal Access Token
# 5. Click "Add secret"
#
# Without REPORT_TOKEN: Only public repositories will be included in the report.
# With REPORT_TOKEN: Both public and private repositories will be included.
