# Daily Repository Report Workflow
#
# This workflow generates a daily report of all repositories owned by EvezArt.
# It fetches repository metadata using the GitHub GraphQL API and outputs both
# JSON and CSV formats as artifacts.
#
# REPORT_TOKEN Setup:
# To include private repositories in the report, you need to set the REPORT_TOKEN
# secret with a GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT) that has 'repo' scope.
#
# CLI setup:
#   echo "YOUR_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN" | gh secret set REPORT_TOKEN --repo EvezArt/crawhub
#
# UI setup:
#   1. Go to Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions
#   2. Click "New repository secret"
#   3. Name: REPORT_TOKEN
#   4. Value: <paste your PAT with repo scope>
#   5. Click "Add secret"
#
# Without REPORT_TOKEN, the workflow will only report on public repositories.
