# Daily Repository Report Workflow
#
# This workflow generates a daily report of all repositories for the EvezArt organization.
# It supports both public and private repositories when properly configured.
#
# REPORT_TOKEN Configuration:
# To include private repositories in the report, set the REPORT_TOKEN secret to a Personal Access Token (PAT)
# with 'repo' scope. Without this token, only public repositories will be included.
#
# Setting the secret via GitHub CLI:
#   echo "YOUR_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN" | gh secret set REPORT_TOKEN --repo EvezArt/crawhub
#
# Setting the secret via GitHub UI:
#   1. Go to: Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions
#   2. Click "New repository secret"
#   3. Name: REPORT_TOKEN
#   4. Value: <your-personal-access-token>
#   5. Click "Add secret"
