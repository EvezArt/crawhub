# Daily Repository Report Workflow
#
# This workflow generates a daily report of all repositories for the EvezArt organization.
# It collects repository metadata via the GitHub GraphQL API and produces JSON and CSV artifacts.
#
# REPORT_TOKEN Configuration:
# To include private repositories in the report, you must configure a Personal Access Token (PAT)
# with 'repo' scope as a repository secret named REPORT_TOKEN.
#
# Setup via GitHub CLI:
#   echo "YOUR_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN" | gh secret set REPORT_TOKEN --repo EvezArt/crawhub
#
# Setup via GitHub UI:
#   1. Navigate to: Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions
#   2. Click "New repository secret"
#   3. Name: REPORT_TOKEN
#   4. Value: Your Personal Access Token with 'repo' scope
#   5. Click "Add secret"
#
# To create a Personal Access Token:
#   1. Go to GitHub Settings > Developer settings > Personal access tokens > Tokens (classic)
#   2. Click "Generate new token (classic)"
#   3. Give it a descriptive name (e.g., "crawhub-repo-report")
#   4. Select the 'repo' scope (Full control of private repositories)
#   5. Click "Generate token"
#   6. Copy the token immediately (you won't be able to see it again)
#
# Note: Without REPORT_TOKEN, only public repositories will be included in the report.
